# Better File Input

`<input type = "file">` is every web designers worst nightmare once they've used it once. Good news, you don't have to worry again. This repo creates a custom element, `<file-input></file-input>`. 

## Features

The custom file input element allows you to create an apparently normal element. You can have some text, you can style it, you can listen to events, etc, but, underneath, it works as a file input. You can access normal file input functionality and more, including file input events like onchange by listening for the event prefixed with $ It's that easy!

The custom file input element also creates functionality to easily check if the input has valid files, what each file size is, what the total file size is, and more!
